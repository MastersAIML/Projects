Like **`layer_forward`** calculates **H** using **W**, **H_prev** and **b**, **`layer_backward`** uses **dH** to calculate **dW**, **dH_prev** and **db**. You have already studied the formulae in backpropogation. To calculate **dZ**, use the **`sigmoid_backward`** and **`relu_backward`** function. You might need to use _[np.dot()](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.dot.html)_, _[np.sum()](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.sum.html)_ for the rest.
