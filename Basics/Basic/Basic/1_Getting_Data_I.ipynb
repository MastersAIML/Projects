    "\n",
    "Web scraping refers to the art of programmatically getting data from the internet.  One of the coolest features of python is that it makes it easy to scrape websites.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python 3, the most popular library for web scraping is ```BeautifulSoup```. To use ```BeautifulSoup```, we will also need the ```requests``` module, which basically connects to a given URL and fetches data from it (in HTML format). A web page is basically HTML code, and the main use of ```BeautifulSoup``` is that it helps you parse HTML easily. \n",
